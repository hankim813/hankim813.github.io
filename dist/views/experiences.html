  Helped define and raise the bar of expected productivity for this role
	<br><br>
  By the time I left, I had closed 5k-6k Zendesk tickets (still holds record for most all time by a Success Engineer) which consisted of understanding customer implementations, debugging, problem solving, and ensuring that customers are successful. 
	<br><br>
  Wrote tons of technical documentation as well as implementation guides.
	<br><br>
  During this time, Segment did not have a dedicated engineering team for all their integrations. Despite not being part of my role, I managed the backlog of bugs by shipping fixes on my own time. This eventually led to my promotion into engineering, product, and design in just one year.
