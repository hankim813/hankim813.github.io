		<h1 class="intro-header mt-md">Han Kim</h1>
		<p class="intro-stats">Solutions Engineer @ Segment</p>
		<p class="intro-description">Han is an entrepreneur at heart constantly adapting and learning from the evolution of his own purpose and passion. Shortly after earning a degree in business administration at <a href="http://www.babson.edu" target="_blank">Babson College</a>, he realized that in order to be reach his desired level of success in the tech industry, he needed to learn how to code.
		<br><br>
    He took a leap of faith and moved to SF in order to attend a rigorous 19-week <a href="http://devbootcamp.com"
      target="_blank">coding program</a> (no longer operating), which taught him how to efficiently learn programming languages. This involved over 1,300+ of coding in those 19 weeks, or ~10 hours a day.
		<br><br>
    Upon graduating this bootcamp, Han started his professional career as a Success Engineer where he cultivated an extremely strong focus to be customer centric. After having to listen to  customer's everyday problems and needs, he eventually decided to take matters into his own hands when it came to influencing the product.  
		<br><br>
    Han always made sure to finish his tasks by 3PM so that he could spend the rest of his day actually shipping code to fix bugs and pains for the customers he would talk to instead of waiting for Software Engineers. Eventually, he started to garner great amount of recognition within the company for going above and beyond.
		<br><br>
    This led to a quick promotion into the Engineering team where he continued to exemplify leadership qualities, earning him the title of Tech Lead for a team of seven engineers a year later. 
		<br><br>
    But the evolution of Han did not cease there. After spending almost two years in product engineering, Han is now focused on selling the product and growing his professional experience on the business side.
    <br><br>
    But when he is not working, Han's fiercest passion is fitness and health. Ask him about his 2017 New Year's resolution and about <i>the</i> Facebook status post.
